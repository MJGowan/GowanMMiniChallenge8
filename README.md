Mini Challenge 8 - Redo
In this project the user will pick a difficulty--easy, medium, or hard--and then they will have to guess a number from that level's range. Their number of attempts/guesses will be counted, and revealed at the end when they find the correct answer.

Review: Elizar Garcia, the game is great! Easy to understand and follow commads. Very well organized and easy to read. Very interactive for the user. The only thing I am seeing wrong with the coding is that its adding the total guess counts together after playing mulitple games. Other then that great job on the game!
